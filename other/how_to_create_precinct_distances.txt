Steps for creating nearest municipalities to precincts!

In QGIS, open the Distance Matrix Tool:
	Go to Processing > Toolbox and search for Distance Matrix.

Configure the Tool:
	Set the Input Layer to centroids (the centroids of the precinct shapefile).
	Set the Target Layer to municipal_seat_lat_long.
	Choose "Use only the nearest (k) target points" and set k = 2.
	Select the output format (e.g., CSV or memory layer).

Analyze the Results:
	The output will list each point and its two nearest neighbors, along with the distances.
